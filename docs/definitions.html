Note that our front-page shooting arrest rates looks at one year of incidents, lagged by 3-months, and arrests through today. If the arrest rate were calculated on October 1, 2022, we would look at incidents that occurred between July 1, 2021 and July 1, 2022 and arrests made between July 1, 2021 and October 1, 2022. We do this because it can take some time for the police to make an arrest in a shooting because of the intense investigation needed.

</ul>
In Philadelphia, people often receive monetary bail conditions (e.g., $10,000), meaning they must pay the Commonwealth some set amount of money to be released from custody while awaiting trial. When the accused successfully completes their trial without missing any appearances or otherwise violating their bail conditions, their money is returned. If they fail to meet their bail conditions, they may lose their bail money. When a person is given cash bail, they can often pay 10% of the full amount (also called “bond”), but will owe the full amount if they violate their bail conditions.

<p>A charge is an accusation by the Commonwealth that a person has committed a crime. Although a case often involves more than one charge, our <a href="Charge_Report.html">Charge Report</a> only looks at the most serious offense charged in each criminal case.</p>
In Philadelphia, the DAO, not the police, is responsible for deciding whether to charge an individual. Generally speaking, police investigate a case and present their investigation to the DAO. The DAO then determines whether there is enough evidence to file criminal charges and what charges should be filed. It is common that a person is charged with multiple offenses in a single criminal case. For example, Simple Assault is often charged at the same time as Recklessly Endangering Another Person.

Diversion
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
Diversion is a procedure by which the DAO removes cases from the usual path through the criminal justice process of incarceration and supervision (probation and parole). The most common form of Diversion allows the accused to participate in a court-sponsored program (often called a problem-solving court). When completed successfully, the diversion program serves the needs of both the participant and the community. Diversion also includes community-based models where the DAO connects participants directly to community organizations to receive services and resources. The programs are designed to be rehabilitative rather than punitive. Their goal is to support individuals who have committed minor offenses to help them avoid future criminal involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of diversionary programs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People are able to stay in the community while being held accountable.</li>
<li>Their specialized nature allows for targeting of specific programs for specific types of people (e.g., drug treatment for people with drug disuse disorders).</li>
<li>Many allow for the charges to be cleared from the accused’s record after successful program completion. This helps people move on from their contact with the criminal justice system without the lifetime burden a criminal record can pose in finding housing, employment, and other important life activities.</li>
<li>They allow the accused to quickly move out of the criminal justice system, bringing swift resolution of the case and reducing loads on overburdened agencies and system actors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <a href="https://phillyda.org/safety-and-justice/alternatives-to-prosecution-incarceration/">common diversion programs in Philadelphia include</a>:</p>

Exoneration
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
In general, an exoneration occurs when a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared based on new evidence of innocence.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.aspx">The more precise definition is more complicated</a>: A person has been exonerated if he or she was convicted of a crime and, following a post-conviction re-examination of the evidence in the case, was either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Declared to be factually innocent by a government official or agency with the authority to make that declaration; or</li>
<li>Relieved of all the consequences of the criminal conviction by a government official or body with the authority to take that action. The official action may be:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>a complete pardon by a governor or other competent authority, whether or not the pardon is designated as based on innocence;</li>
<li>an acquittal of all charges factually related to the crime for which the person was originally convicted; or</li>
<li>a dismissal of all charges related to the crime for which the person was originally convicted, by a court or by a prosecutor with the authority to enter that dismissal.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The pardon, acquittal, or dismissal must have been the result, at least in part, of evidence of innocence that either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>was not presented at the trial at which the person was convicted; or</li>
<li>if the person pled guilty, was not known to the defendant and the defense attorney, and to the court, at the time the plea was entered.</li>
</ol>
The evidence of innocence need not be an explicit basis for the official action that exonerated the person. A person who otherwise qualifies has not been exonerated if there is unexplained physical evidence of that person’s guilt.

Fraud/Theft of Services
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
Fraud is intentionally lying or manipulating the truth in order to gain something of value. Theft of services, similarly, occurs when a person gets the benefit of a service known to cost money (e.g. turnstile jumping). The Philadelphia DAO generally charges offense classified at arrest as ‘fraud’ as ‘theft’ under the criminal code. This combined classification is only available in incident data.
</div>
<div id="futureyearsofincarceration" class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Incarceration
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
All of the years of incarceration imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, the future years of incarceration imposed in Philadelphia on a particular day can be calculated by adding up all of the carceral sentences imposed on all defendants in Philadelphia that day.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate future years of incarceration, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the jail/prison time that we assume a person will serve.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g., a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years).</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of parole or probation.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Larry Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of future incarceration and future supervision. Overly long prison sentences and terms of parole and probation cost millions in public dollars without improving public safety. In fact, research show that mass incarceration and over-supervision actually have a negative effect on people and communities. By making plea offers and sentencing recommendations below the low end of the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, DA Krasner has espoused a different approach to sentencing policy. This will save millions of dollars that could be used to improve education, repair infrastructure and improve living conditions for all Philadelphians, while at the same time insuring that criminal behavior is punished appropriately.
</div>
<div id="futureyearsofsupervision" class="dao-definition-title-word">
Future Years of Supervision
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>All of the years of supervision imposed on defendants in all cases that ended in a given time period. For example, the future years of supervision imposed in Philadelphia on a particular day can be calculated by adding up all of the probation and parole sentences imposed on all defendants in Philadelphia that day.</p>
<p>To calculate future years of supervision, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We only track the supervision time that a person will actually serve.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in the Philadelphia jails (sentences with a maximum of less than 2 years) will be released at their minimum sentence length. The balance of their sentence (max - min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Anyone serving time in state prison (sentences with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more) will be released at 130% of their minimum sentence (e.g. a person with a 1-2 year sentence will be released in 1.3 years). The balance of their sentence (max - 1.3 x min) is counted as supervision.</li>
<li>Consolidated sentences are treated as concurrent, not consecutive. When a person is sentenced in multiple cases on a single day, we assume that these cases have been consolidated and dealt with as a group. For the purpose of future years, we only look at the longest minimum and maximum sentences from that group of cases.</li>
<li>We only look at original sentences, not violations of probation or parole.</li>
</ol>
One of the goals of DA Krasner’s policies is to reduce the number of years of Future Supervision. Research shows that periods of probation or parole supervision that last beyond three years without any violations have diminishing returns and instead keep people needlessly ensnared in the system. In making plea offers and sentencing recommendations, the DAO is very cognizant of this finding. Because of the requirements of Pennsylvania’s sentencing laws, it is not always possible to limit parole following an sentence to incarceration for a reasonable amount of time. But, to the extent possible, the DAO is attempting to reduce the amount of time people are required to spend on probation and parole.

After a case has passed a preliminary Hearing and has made it to the Court of Common Pleas, the DAO must file a motion to ‘nolle pros’ any charges that it wants to withdrawn. Similar to withdrawals, a case may be nolle prossed due to a change in circumstances (such as an unavailable witness), a determination by the DAO that the case lacks sufficient evidence to proceed (perhaps because evidence was suppressed), or because of an agreement made between the DAO and the defendant to nolle pros some charges in exchange for a guilty plea on other charges. ‘Nolle prosequi’ is Latin for ‘Not wish to prosecute’.

In order to identify non-fatal shooting cases, we link incidents to a shooting victims dataset.</li>
</ul>
On the Dashboard, we only classify an arrest or case as a non-fatal shooting if the incident itself appears in the shooting victims data set and the most serious charge (or police recommended charge) was one of: “Attempted Homicide”, “Assault”, “Aggravated Assault”, or “Robbery”. On the Incidents page, we count the number of non-fatal shooting victims rather than the number of non-fatal shooting incidents.

Open Cases at End of Period
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>On our case outcomes page, in addition to how many cases were disposed of in each time period, we also measure how many cases remained active at the end of each time period. This allows a comparison between the number of cases adjudicated in a year with the size of the backlog that the court was facing at that same moment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the case backlog has grown considerably as the courts have not been operating at full capacity. Two important impacts of this are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Many cases stay open for far longer than in the past. For victims who have to wait for resolution to their case, this can be agonizing. For defendants sitting in jail pretrial, the lack of resolution and continued detention also causes great harm. Even for defendants that were released pretrial, having an open case can be extremely destabilizing.</li>
<li>stronger cases, which require more hearings and potentially a trial, stay active in the system while weaker cases are dismissed immediately. This has led to a lower conviction rate during the pandemic than other times. We believe that the conviction rate after the courts reopen at full capacity will be higher than normal, although that is subject to other factors such as evidence becoming stale.

Victim/Witness Intimidation &amp; Retaliation
</div>
<div class='dao-definition'>
Intimidating a witness or victim of a crime in order to prevent them from providing information, coerce them to provide false information or to withhold information, to prevent them from testifying in court, or retaliating against a witness or victim of a crime who has already provided information or testified. It is important to note that this category only includes those arrests and cases where it is considered the most serious charge. In many cases, this offense is charged alongside a higher-ranked charge, e.g. Aggravated Assault or Homicide.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Dashboard, this includes arrests and cases where the most serious charge (or police recommended charge) was one of:</p>

Withdrawn

<div class='dao-definition'>
If, after bring charges in a case, the District Attorney’s Office decides to not move forward with the case due to an unavailable witness or for other related reasons, the DAO may withdraw the case. Withdrawn charges may later be refiled. Withdrawals almost always happen in Municipal Court, regardless of whether the case is a felony or a misdemeanor.</li>
</ul>
For the purpose of the dashboard, we have also counted cases dismissed for ‘Lack of Prosecution’ (LOP) because it means something similar. A case is dismissed LOP when the DAO is not ready to proceed, but the judge does not grant a continuance.

<div id="withdrawnintheinterestofjustice" class="dao-definition-title-word">
Withdrawn in the Interest of Justice
</div>
<div class="dao-definition">
<p>There are times when withdrawing a case can better serve the goals of the criminal legal system than continuing to prosecute a case.</p>
<p>Some examples of why a case may be withdrawn in the interest of justice include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal of a drug possession case where the defendant has shown proof of seeing a treatment provider.</li>
<li>Withdrawal of a less serious domestic violence case where the victim does not want to continue with the prosecution and the defendant has shown proof of attendance at anger management classes or has completed significant community sevice hours.<br />
</li>
<li>Withdrawal of a minor case against a non-citizen where the immigration consequences of a conviction would far outweigh the gravity of the crime.</li>
<li>Withdrawal of a minor offense against a person in custody in another state for a serious offense (e.g. a person is currently held for a murder trial in Texas, but also has an open retail theft case in Philadelphia).</li>
<li>Withdrawal of a drug possession case for a first time offender.</li>
</ul>
The DAO has been withdrawing cases in the interest of justice for decades, to help the DAO manage caseloads, to avoid over-penalizing people, and to find create ways to allow for diversion-like programs when diversion may not be available for an individual. This is a process that has never been formally tracked within the District Attorney’s Office, so it is likely that we are under-counting Withdrawals in the Interest of Justice. For the purpose of the Dashboard, we mark a case as Withdrawn in the Interest of Justice if the disposition of the case is withdrawn and the withdrawal took place in CJC room 404.
